# FreeCell
## Description
    The 'FreeCell' project is a software rendition of the classic card game of the same name. The objective of the game is to fill all four foundation piles (located at the top right), where each pile can only contain one suit in ascending order.

## Features
    The project features a game board with all 52 cards shuffled and stacked on the eight tableau piles. Cards are moved by clicking and dragging with the mouse and inserted at the cursor's position. The movement and selection of cards is based on the games rules such as not being able to place a 3 of hearts on a 10 of spades. In addition to dragging cards, cards can be quickly tapped to play the 'best move'.
